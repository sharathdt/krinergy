       <h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
        <p>This page is not visible to search engines. This is only meant for the website documentation.</p>
        
        <h2>Domain:</h2>
        <p>The Domain is bought from Google Domains. Forwarding emails are setup here.</p>
        
        <h2>Hosting:</h2>
        <p>Currently, the website is hosted using GitHub Pages. For a standard traffic this hosting is fine. My own website <code>https://blog.webjeda.com</code> is hosted on GitHub and I have not faced any issue so far.</p>
        <p>It is true that anyone can copy the entire website if they are hosted on GitHub public repository but if someone wants to copy the entire website, they can do it from your website as well. </p>
        <p>As long as you do not have any user data or sensitive information stored in it, you are safe to keep the site in GitHub.</p>
        <p>Moving to AWS is the best choice when the website gets high traffic. But making changes once it is moved can be complicated. This is why I would like to keep the site in GitHub for sometime.</p>

        <h2>DNS:</h2> 
        <p>Currently, DNS is setup using CloudFlare. I'm using it for development purposes. The same DNS can be(should be) setup on google domains soon. I'm posting the DNS screenshot below so that if you have to change it in the future then you can do so.</p>
        <p>But before doing this change on Google Domains, please remove the custom nameservers that are set up.</p>     
        <img src="/images/dns-settings.png" alt="" width="100%">  
        <p>Please contact me before doing this change.</p>
        
        <h2>Design:</h2>
        <p>The website uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for its design. I have used Google Form for the "call me back" form. Google map iframe for map shown in Contact page. I have optimized all the images for faster loading.</p>
        <p>I have edited your logo for its shape and scaled it to required size.</p>
        
        <h2>SEO:</h2>
        <p>Basic SEO is already in place. You can observe that in the "view source" option where it reads something as shown below.</p>
        
            <pre><code>
            -- Begin Jekyll SEO tag v2.5.0 --
            --  End Jekyll SEO tag --
        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>That should be enough for search engines to read the site properly.</p>
        
        <h2>Sitemap Submission:</h2>
        <p>The sitemap for the website is available at <code>http://thesunenergysystems.com/sitemap.xml</code>. Make sure all the pages are listed in it. Submit this to search engines.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes:</h2>
        <p>Any changes you would like to make to the content of the website can be done either in <code>_data/data.yml</code>, <code>_products</code> or <code>_pages</code>.</p>
        <p>I do not recommend editing any other file since it may break the site.</p>
