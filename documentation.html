        <p>This page is not visible to search engines. This is only meant for the website documentation.</p>
        
        <h2>Domain:</h2>
        <p>The Domain is bought from Google Domains. Forwarding emails are setup here.</p>
        
        <h2>Hosting:</h2>
        <p>Currently, the website is hosted using GitHub Pages. For a standard traffic this hosting is fine. My own website <code>https://blog.webjeda.com</code> is hosted on GitHub and I have not faced any issue so far.</p>
        <p>It is true that anyone can copy the entire website if they are hosted on GitHub public repository but if someone wants to copy the entire website, they can do it from your website as well. </p>
        <p>As long as you do not have any user data or sensitive information stored in it, you are safe to keep the site in GitHub.</p>
        <p>Moving to AWS is the best choice when the website gets high traffic. But making changes once it is moved can be complicated. This is why I would like to keep the site in GitHub for sometime.</p>

        <h2>DNS:</h2> 
        <p>Currently, DNS is setup using CloudFlare. The same DNS can be setup on google domains. This is done for my convenience. I'm posting the DNS screenshot below so that if you have to change it in the future then you can do so.</p>
        <p>But before doing this change on Google Domains, please remove the custom nameservers that are set up.</p>
